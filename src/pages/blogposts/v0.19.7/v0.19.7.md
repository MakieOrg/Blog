# Makie v0.19.7

We have a new release for you which - even though it takes the form of an unassuming patch - comes which a bunch of long-awaited changes and additions.

## Polar axis

[PR #2990](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2990)

Frederic put in a lot of work and finished an effort originally started by Anshul ([#2014](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2014)) and Julius.
Now, Makie finally has its own polar axis.
We consider this an experimental feature for now, which means that breaking changes to the implementation are more likely once users start testing it.

## Color scales

[PR #2900](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2900)

This work was a joint effort by t-bltg ([#2900](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2493)) and Simon.
Now you can pass scaling functions via the `colorscale` parameter
to plotting primitives that take numerical colors and colormaps.
The numbers will then be pre-transformed before being looked up in the colormap, allowing you to quickly visualize exponential and other nonlinearly distributed data.

## Alpha keyword

[PR #2900](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2900)

With the colorscale rework, Simon refactored the internal color handling which also resulted in the implementation of an `alpha` keyword for most primitive plot types.
This alpha value simply acts as a multiplier for any colors passed or looked up in colormaps (as opposed to a layer-based compositing alpha).

```julia
# hide
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!(type="svg")
```
```julia
f, _ = lines(0..8, sin, color = :blue, linewidth = 10)
lines!(0..8, cos, color = :red, alpha = 0.5, linewidth = 10)
f
```

## DelaunayTriangulation.jl support for `tricontourf`

[PR #2896](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2896)

This work by Daniel switched the internal handler of triangulation computations in Makie from jll-based MiniQHull to his own package [DelaunayTriangulation.jl](https://github.com/DanielVandH/DelaunayTriangulation.jl/) written completely in Julia. This allows users to exert much more control over the triangulations used for their `tricontourf` plots.

Here's a more comprehensive list of changes which can also be found at [docs.makie.org/stable/news/](https://docs.makie.org/stable/news/).

We hope you enjoy the new release!

### Changelog v0.19.7

- Allow arbitrary functions to color `streamplot` lines by passing a `Function` to `color`.  This must accept `Point` of the appropriate dimension and return a `Point`, `Vec`, or other arraylike object [#2002](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2002).
- `arrows` can now take input of the form `x::AbstractVector, y::AbstractVector, [z::AbstractVector,] f::Function`, where `f` must return a `VecTypes` of the appropriate dimension [#2597](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2597).
- Exported colorbuffer, and added `colorbuffer(axis::Axis; include_decorations=false, colorbuffer_kws...)`, to get an image of an axis with or without decorations [#3078](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3078).
- Fixed an issue where the `linestyle` of some polys was not applied to the stroke in CairoMakie. [#2604](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2604)
- Add `colorscale = identity` to any plotting function using a colormap. This works with any scaling function like `log10`, `sqrt` etc. Consequently, `scale` for `hexbin` is replaced with `colorscale` [#2900](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2900).
- Add `alpha=1.0` argument to all basic plots, which supports independently adding an alpha component to colormaps and colors. Multiple alphas like in `plot(alpha=0.2, color=RGBAf(1, 0, 0, 0.5))`, will get multiplied [#2900](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2900).
- `hexbin` now supports any per-observation weights which StatsBase respects - `<: StatsBase.AbstractWeights`, `Vector{Real}`, or `nothing` (the default). [#2804](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pulls/2804)
- Added a new Axis type, `PolarAxis`, which is an axis with a polar projection.  Input is in `(r, theta)` coordinates and is transformed to `(x, y)` coordinates using the standard polar-to-cartesian transformation.
  Generally, its attributes are very similar to the usual `Axis` attributes, but `x` is replaced by `r` and `y` by `Î¸`.
  It also inherits from the theme of `Axis` in this manner, so should work seamlessly with Makie themes [#2990](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2990).
- `inherit` now has a new signature `inherit(scene, attrs::NTuple{N, Symbol}, default_value)`, allowing recipe authors to access nested attributes when trying to inherit from the parent Scene.
  For example, one could inherit from `scene.Axis.yticks` by `inherit(scene, (:Axis, :yticks), $default_value)` [#2990](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2990).
- Fixed incorrect rendering of 3D heatmaps [#2959](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2959)
- Deprecated `flatten_plots` in favor of `collect_atomic_plots`. Using the new `collect_atomic_plots` fixed a bug in CairoMakie where the z-level of plots within recipes was not respected. [#2793](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2793)
- Fixed incorrect line depth in GLMakie [#2843](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2843)
- Fixed incorrect line alpha in dense lines in GLMakie [#2843](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2843)
- Fixed DataInspector interaction with transformations [#3002](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3002)
- Added option `WGLMakie.activate!(resize_to_body=true)`, to make plots resize to the VSCode plotpane. Resizes to the HTML body element, so may work outside VSCode [#3044](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3044), [#3042](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3042).
- Fixed DataInspector interaction with transformations [#3002](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3002).
- Fix incomplete stroke with some Bezier markers in CairoMakie and blurry strokes in GLMakie [#2961](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2961)
- Added the ability to use custom triangulations from DelaunayTriangulation.jl [#2896](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2896).
- Adjusted scaling of scatter/text stroke, glow and anti-aliasing width under non-uniform 2D scaling (Vec2f markersize/fontsize) in GLMakie [#2950](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2950).
- Scaled `errorbar` whiskers and `bracket` correctly with transformations [#3012](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3012).
- Updated `bracket` when the screen is resized or transformations change [#3012](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3012).
