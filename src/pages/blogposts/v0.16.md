# Makie 0.16 release

## Simon Danisch

### RPRMakie

A new raytracing backend got added, which is based on AMDs high quality and production ready [RadeonProRender](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/RadeonProRender.jl).
It's still experimental and not all Makie features are supported, but it's already at a staged where one can create some pretty amazing visualizations.
From the [backend docs](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/documentation/backends/rprmakie/):

```julia
# hide
base_url = "https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/assets/"
images = ["lego_walk.mp4", "earth.png", "materials.png", "opengl_interop.mp4", "topographie.png"]
urls = base_url .* images
entries = map(urls) do url
    class = "m-2 h-60"
    elem = if endswith(url, ".mp4")
        return DOM.video(
            DOM.source(src=url, type="video/mp4"),
            autoplay=false, controls=true, class=class)
    else
        DOM.img(src=url, class=class)
    end
    return DOM.div(elem)
end
DOM.div(
    entries...,
    class="flex flex-wrap"
)
```

### Scene refactor

In ancient Makie, the `Scene` type was the main object to plot into.
With the integration of MakieLayout, this changed and Figure/Axis became the main user facing types.
That turned `Scene` into a lower level type, but we never removed all the high-level constructs to control limits, axis etc.
In this refactor, all higher level constructs got removed and turned the `Scene` type into a leaner scene graph type.
These changes shouldn't be breaking for anyone working with the MakieLayout figure API. Breaking changes for the Scene API are explained in the [NEWS.md](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/blob/master/NEWS.md):

>The Scene() constructor doesn't create any axes or limits anymore. All keywords like raw, show_axis have been removed. A scene now always works like it did when using the deprecated raw=true. All the high level functionality like showing an axis and adding a 3d camera has been moved to LScene.

See the new [Scene tutorial](https://makie.juliaplots.org/dev/tutorials/scenes/) for more info.

Also, lights got moved from being a plot attributes to being a scene attribute, which is described in the [light section](https://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/documentation/lighting/#examples)


## Frederic Freyer

### Fix fuzzy text

Frederic heroically fixed a very long standing GLMakie bug in the text rendering, that made the text look fuzzy.
GLMakie offers high quality text rendering again now :)

### OIT

Order independent transparency has been on the wishlist for GLMakie for a very long time.
It's still an approximation, so you may run into inaccurate transparency, but it should be much better then before:

```julia
using GLMakie
GLMakie.activate!()
fig = Figure()
left = LScene(fig[1, 1])
right = LScene(fig[1, 2])

mesh!(left, Rect2f(-1, -1, 2, 1), color = :blue)
mesh!(right, Rect2f(-1, -1, 2, 1), color = :blue)

mesh!(left, Sphere(Point3f(0), 1f0), color = (:orange, 0.5))
mesh!(right, Sphere(Point3f(0), 1f0), color = (:orange, 0.5), transparency = true)
fig
```

### Depth shift

To enable better wireframe renderings over meshes, Frederic added a depth shift attribute, which can shift an objects depth **after** applying all projections:

```julia
f = Figure(resolution=(900, 500))
s = Sphere(Point3f(0), 1)
for (i, depth) in enumerate([-0.01f0, 0f0, 0.01f0])
    ax = LScene(f[1, i]; show_axis=false)
    mesh!(ax, s, color=rand(100, 100))
    wireframe!(ax, s; depth_shift=depth,
        transparency=true, color=(:white, 0.5), linewidth=4)
end
f
```

### Add depth to volumes

Volumes used the depth of the cube they're rendered into, which results in bad depth clipping.
Now, volume and contour plots emit correct depth values for opaque pixels:
```julia
fig = Figure()
left = LScene(fig[1, 1])
contour!(left, [sin(i+j) * sin(j+k) * sin(i+k) for i in 1:10, j in 1:10, k in 1:10], enable_depth = true)
mesh!(left, Sphere(Point3f(5), 6f0))
right = LScene(fig[1, 2])
volume!(right, [sin(2i) * sin(2j) * sin(2k) for i in 1:10, j in 1:10, k in 1:10], algorithm = :iso, enable_depth = true)
mesh!(right, Sphere(Point3f(5), 6f0))
fig
```

## Julius Krumbiegel

Some figures with aspect ratio restrictions or fixed objects sizes use more or less than the allotted space. With the new command resize_to_layout!, a Figure can be adjusted so it uses exactly the size necessary for its current content.

```julia
f = Figure(resolution = (800, 500), backgroundcolor = :gray80)
ax = Axis(f[1, 1], title = "Before resize_to_layout!")
Colorbar(f[1, 2])
colsize!(f.layout, 1, Aspect(1, 1.0))
f
```

```julia
ax.title = "After resize_to_layout!"
resize_to_layout!(f)
f
```

Plots can now be given attributes that pick a specific value from the current cycle using the Cycled() struct, for example to choose the 3rd color from the current palette.

```julia
using Statistics
f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1], title = "Cycled() attributes")
data = [randn(100) .+ i for i in [1, 3, 5]]
for i in 1:3
    density!(ax, data[i])
end
vlines!(ax, median(data[3]), color = Cycled(3), linewidth = 4)
f
```
