# v0.19.9-12


## Datashader [#2883](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2883)

Makie has its own [datashader](https://docs.makie.org/stable/reference/plots/datashader/) plot type now. This is fast CPU-based binning algorithm that automatically adjusts the domain it's applied to to the current axis limits. It's useful to explore large datasets, such as this dataset with 14 million points

```julia
# hide
using Bonito
DOM.video(DOM.source(src="https://docs.makie.org/v0.21/assets/datashader-14million.Vl17VWzZ.mp4", type="video/mp4"),
            autoplay=true, muted=true, loop=true, controls=true)
```

Or this one with 3.2 billion points

```julia
# hide
DOM.video(DOM.source(src="https://docs.makie.org/v0.21/assets/datashader_2-7_billion.D1p2iTV4.mp4", type="video/mp4"),
            autoplay=true, muted=true, loop=true, controls=true)
```

It can be customized with different aggregation functions as well as local and global transformations.
The `datashader` plot type is currently considered experimental and might experience API breakage in patch versions.

## PolarAxis improvements [#3154](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3154)

PolarAxis has gotten a large number of changes, some of which are breaking. As we currently consider PolarAxis an experimental feature, we have pushed those changes through in a patch version.

The most important breaking change is that the order of arguments has been reversed to be in line with other plotting packages. By default plots that use the Polar transform now take arguments `(theta, r)`.  This can be reversed by setting `theta_as_x = false` in the transform or the PolarAxis.

```julia
using CairoMakie
fig = Figure(resolution = (800, 450))
ax1 = PolarAxis(fig[1, 1], theta_as_x = true, title = "theta_as_x = true (default)")
ax2 = PolarAxis(fig[1, 2], theta_as_x = false, title = "theta_as_x = false")
lines!(ax1, 0:0.05:2.0, [2 for _ in 1:41])
lines!(ax2, 0:0.05:2.0, [2 for _ in 1:41])
rlims!.((ax1, ax2), 0, 2.5)
fig
```


Most of the other changes revolve around plotting on sectors, i.e. limits where $r_0 > 0$ and/or $\theta$ spans less than 2$\pi$. This means that PolarAxis now has `thetalimits = (thetamin, thetamax)` as a new attribute and that `radius = rmax` has been replaced by `rlimits = (rmin, rmax)`.

```julia
r = range(0.3pi, 0.7pi, length=21)
xs = vcat(r, [r[end] for _ in 1:20], r[end:-1:1], [r[1] for _ in 1:20])
ys = vcat([r[1] for _ in 1:20], r, [r[end] for _ in 1:20], r[end:-1:1])
fig = Figure(resolution = (800, 500))
ax = PolarAxis(fig[1, 1], rlimits = (r[1]-0.1, r[end]+0.1), thetalimits = (r[1]-0.1, r[end]+0.1))
lines!(ax, xs, ys)
fig
```

There are many other small changes related to making this work, such as changes to `autolimits`, interactivity, tick placement and the behind-the-scenes rendering of the PolarAxis. You can find a summary of these changes in the pull request.

## Colorbar [#3090](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3090)

Refactors Colorbar to use image and heatmap instead of the heavier poly + image.
Uses now ColorMapping, internally in Colorbar, to have a more consistent interface, while keeping construction of `Colorbar(colormap=cmap, ...)` still working.

Introduces `extract_colormap`, which Colorbar now uses to extract the colormapping from any plot type.
The function has a fallback for any recipe, which recursively searches the child plots. One can also directly overload it for a recipe, where this isn't a good default. Will error if multiple colormappings are found in a recipe.
Introduced an experimental `colormap=Categorical(colormap)`, which creates a true categorical colormap:
```julia
f, ax, pl = barplot(1:3, color=1:3, colormap=Makie.Categorical(:viridis))
Colorbar(f[1, 2], pl)
f
```

## ReversibleScale [#3095](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3095)

Add and export ReversibleScale type, which makes it easier to create custom scale types, while still getting correct ticks in Colorbar and Axis.


## Delaunay Recipes [#3102](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3102), [#3159](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3159)

Thanks to [Daniel VandenHeuvel](https://github.com/DanielVandH) Makie now has two new plotting functions - `triplot` and `voronoiplot`. These have been moved from [DelaunayTriangulation.jl ](https://github.com/DanielVandH/DelaunayTriangulation.jl). The former, `triplot`, will generate a triangulation given an abitrary set of 2D points.

```julia
using Random
grid = shuffle([Point2f(x, y) for x in 1:4 for y in 1:4])
f, a, p = triplot(grid, figure = (resolution = (500, 400),))
```

The latter, `voronoiplot`, will generate cells around points where the edges are halfway between neighboring points. These plots can be used as heatmaps for data that does not lie on a grid. As such they can be used as a replacement for heatmap in PolarAxis.

```julia
fig = Figure()
voronoiplot(fig[1, 1], rand(100), rand(100))
ax = PolarAxis(fig[1, 2], theta_0 = -pi/2)
xs = range(0, pi, length=30)
ys = range(1, 2, length=10)
zs = [theta for theta in xs, _ in ys]
voronoiplot!(ax, xs, ys, zs, show_generators = false, colormap = [:white, :lightgreen, :yellow, :darkred])
autolimits!(ax)
fig
```


## Bar label alignment [#3177](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3177)

Improved the automatic barplot label alignment and added the attribute `label_align` for custom placement.


## Tex theme [#3180](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3180)

Added a theme `theme_latexfonts` that uses the latex font family as default fonts

```julia
set_theme!(theme_latexfonts())

fig = Figure()
Label(fig[1, 1], "A standard Label", tellwidth = false)
Label(fig[2, 1], L"A LaTeXString with a small formula $x^2$", tellwidth = false)
Axis(fig[3, 1], title = "An axis with matching font for the tick labels")
fig
```

## Docs improvements [#3183](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3183), [#3185](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3185) & [#3244](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3244)

In the process of making the docs more structured, the `Examples` section was renamed to `Reference` and the `Documentation` section to `Explanations`, a how-to section was also recently added on master. In the future, it should become easier to find concrete information about what each plot and block does and how the attributes behave.

The docs style was overhauled a little as well. The page content overview on the right is now separate from the navigation on the left. This way, everything should stay more readable, especially on large pages with many sections. The docs now make better use of the available screen width.

The static search plugin was changed from [`stork`](https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork) to [`pagefind`](https://pagefind.app/docs/) as `stork` is not being maintained anymore. On desktop, the search should be easier to read as it lives in its own modal now.

## Linestyle type [#3193](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3193), [#3135](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/3135)

Deprecates `linestyle=Vector{<:Real}` for custom linestyles in favor of `linestyle=Linestyle(value::Vector{<:Real})`, to make it less ambigious if the attribute is per linepoint or for the whole line.
