<div class="admonition warning"><p class="title">Warning&#33;</p>    Note that the new &#96;&#64;recipe&#96; syntax is undocumented and considered internal for now. It could experience breaking changes in patch versions as we  make further improvements to it. This also means that third party recipes written with the old &#96;&#64;recipe&#96; syntax will continue to work as they are and not automatically receive the benefits of the new system.
