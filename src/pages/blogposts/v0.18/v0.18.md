# Makie v0.18

We're happy to announce Makie's latest feature release: **v0.18**!
A lot of effort has gone into this version, the longest standing PR saw 1.5 years of continued work! We have added exciting new features, fixed many issues, and made important improvements to the backends which are going to increase performance and stability going forward.

Below is a short summary of the most relevant changes in no particular order:

## Tricontourf

The new `tricontourf` plot can be used to plot contour bands for points in arbitrary configuration, compared to `contourf` which requires a grid. You can pass your own triangulation data or use the default Delaunay triangulation.
```julia
# hide
using CairoMakie
using Random
Random.seed!(123)

n = 20
angles = range(0, 2pi, length = n+1)[1:end-1]
x = [cos.(angles); 2 .* cos.(angles .+ pi/n)]
y = [sin.(angles); 2 .* sin.(angles .+ pi/n)]
z = (x .- 0.5).^2 + (y .- 0.5).^2 .+ 0.5.*randn.()

triangulation_inner = reduce(hcat, map(i -> [0, 1, n] .+ i, 1:n))
triangulation_outer = reduce(hcat, map(i -> [n-1, n, 0] .+ i, 1:n))
triangulation = hcat(triangulation_inner, triangulation_outer)

f, ax, _ = tricontourf(x, y, z, triangulation = triangulation,
    axis = (; aspect = 1, title = "Manual triangulation"), figure=(resolution=(800, 400),))
scatter!(x, y, color = z, strokewidth = 1, strokecolor = :black)

tricontourf(f[1, 2], x, y, z, triangulation = Makie.DelaunayTriangulation(),
    axis = (; aspect = 1, title = "Delaunay triangulation"))
scatter!(x, y, color = z, strokewidth = 1, strokecolor = :black)
f
```

## Hexbin

The new `hexbin` plot allows to visualize the density of points in hexagonal cells. Compared to `heatmap` etc., the hexagonal layout helps to break up horizontal and vertical lines that can be misleading when interpreting the data.

```julia
# hide
using CairoMakie
using DelimitedFiles
CairoMakie.activate!(type="svg")

a = map(Point2f, eachrow(readdlm(assetpath("airportlocations.csv"))))

f, ax, hb = hexbin(a,
    cellsize = 6,
    axis = (; aspect = DataAspect()),
    figure = (; resolution=(1000, 500)),
    threshold = 0,
    colormap = [Makie.to_color(:transparent); Makie.to_colormap(:viridis)],
    strokewidth = 0.5,
    strokecolor = :gray50,
    scale = Makie.pseudolog10)

tightlimits!(ax)

Colorbar(f[1, 2], hb,
    label = "Number of airports",
    ticks = (0:3, ["0", "10", "100", "1000"]),
    height = Relative(0.5)
)

Makie.resize_to_layout!(f)
f
```

## Bezier path markers

You can now use arbitrary shapes as scatter markers, which can be defined using the `BezierPath` object.
For convenience, such paths can also be constructed from svg path strings.

This change allowed us to improve the default set of markers, which previously relied on the glyphs supplied by Makie's default fonts and which have been chosen to match better visually.

```julia
# hide
markers_labels = [
    (:circle, ":circle"),
    (:rect, ":rect"),
    (:diamond, ":diamond"),
    (:hexagon, ":hexagon"),
    (:cross, ":cross"),
    (:xcross, ":xcross"),
    (:utriangle, ":utriangle"),
    (:dtriangle, ":dtriangle"),
    (:ltriangle, ":ltriangle"),
    (:rtriangle, ":rtriangle"),
    (:pentagon, ":pentagon"),
    (:star4, ":star4"),
    (:star5, ":star5"),
    (:star6, ":star6"),
    (:star8, ":star8"),
    (:vline, ":vline"),
    (:hline, ":hline"),
    ('a', "'a'"),
    ('B', "'B'"),
    ('↑', "'\\uparrow'"),
    ('😄', "'\\:smile:'"),
    ('✈', "'\\:airplane:'"),
]

f = Figure()
ax = Axis(f[1, 1], yreversed = true,
    xautolimitmargin = (0.15, 0.15),
    yautolimitmargin = (0.15, 0.15)
)
hidedecorations!(ax)

for (i, (marker, label)) in enumerate(markers_labels)
    p = Point2f(fldmod1(i, 6)...)

    scatter!(p, marker = marker, markersize = 20, color = :black)
    text!(p, text = label, color = :gray70, offset = (0, 20),
        align = (:center, :bottom))
end

f
```

One possible real-world application are wind barb plots which are common in geography. Here's a not-so-real-world example where we plot bat symbols read from an svg path string.

```julia
# hide
using CairoMakie; CairoMakie.activate!(type="svg");
```

```julia
using CairoMakie

batsymbol_string = "M96.84 141.998c-4.947-23.457-20.359-32.211-25.862-13.887-11.822-22.963-37.961-16.135-22.041 6.289-3.005-1.295-5.872-2.682-8.538-4.191-8.646-5.318-15.259-11.314-19.774-17.586-3.237-5.07-4.994-10.541-4.994-16.229 0-19.774 21.115-36.758 50.861-43.694.446-.078.909-.154 1.372-.231-22.657 30.039 9.386 50.985 15.258 24.645l2.528-24.367 5.086 6.52H103.205l5.07-6.52 2.543 24.367c5.842 26.278 37.746 5.502 15.414-24.429 29.777 6.951 50.891 23.936 50.891 43.709 0 15.136-12.406 28.651-31.609 37.267 14.842-21.822-10.867-28.266-22.549-5.549-5.502-18.325-21.147-9.341-26.125 13.886z"

batsymbol = BezierPath(batsymbol_string, fit = true, flipy = true)

scatter(1:10, marker = batsymbol, markersize = 50, color = :black)
```

Another common requirement are custom arrows and other shapes used to annotate plots. These can be constructed using path primitives including arcs and bezier curves, or specified as simple polygons made from line segments.

```julia
using CairoMakie

arrow_path = BezierPath([
    MoveTo(Point(0, 0)),
    LineTo(Point(0.3, -0.3)),
    LineTo(Point(0.15, -0.3)),
    LineTo(Point(0.3, -1)),
    LineTo(Point(0, -0.9)),
    LineTo(Point(-0.3, -1)),
    LineTo(Point(-0.15, -0.3)),
    LineTo(Point(-0.3, -0.3)),
    ClosePath()
])

scatter(1:5,
    marker = arrow_path,
    markersize = range(20, 50, length = 5),
    rotations = range(0, 2pi, length = 6)[1:end-1],
)
```

## Rework of text drawing for compatibility with MathTeXEngine v0.5

In the past, MathTeXEngine.jl could not use some commonly required glyphs, because these were not representable using Unicode `Char`s.
By reworking Makie's backend to specify glyphs directly with their integer offsets, we gained the ability to use the full breadth of available characters. The new capabilities are available from MathTeXEngine v0.5 on.

## Updates to DataInspector ([#2095](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2095))

`DataInspector` got a refactor to simplify future updates. Along the way we cleaned up and moved the tooltip code to a `tooltip(pos, text)` recipe. Many of the attributes of `tooltip` can also be passed to `DataInspector`.

```julia
using CairoMakie

fig, ax, p = scatter(Point2f(0), marker = 'x', markersize = 20)
tooltip!(Point2f(0), "This is a tooltip pointing at x")
fig
```

We also added a commonly requested feature - being able to adjust the displayed text on a per-plot basis. `DataInspector` will now check if a hovered plot has a `inspector_label` attribute and call `plot.inspector_label[](plot, index, position)` to get text to display if it is available. For example:

```julia
labels = ["first", "second", "third"]
fig, ax, p = scatter(rand(3), inspector_label = (plot, i, pos) -> labels[i])
DataInspector(fig)
nothing
```

Another small change is that tooltips now persist when alt-tabbing out of the Makie window. This should make it a bit easier to copy or compare data.

## Display refactor ([#2306](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2306))

### GLMakie Bug fixes

* Fix Heisenbug for multiple windows, where shaders got compiled for the wrong window (OpenGL context), which works fine on most nvidia hardware but may crash other OpenGL implementations.
* Due to the above fix, it became clear that the scene clean up after displaying on a screen wasn't happening correctly, which got fixed
* `enable_SSAO`/`enable_FXAA`/`transparency_weight_scale` were a global, which was fine until we got multi window support. Now, ssao/fxaa/oit are screen options, which you can set via e.g. `GLMakie.activate!(ssao=true)` or per screen via `GLMakie.Screen(ssao=true)`.

### Saving + record

* new backend argument, allowing one to save a file with a specific backend (`save("plot.png", figure; backend=GLMakie)`). Applies also to `record`, `display` and `colorbuffer`.
* `record`, `display`, `colorbuffer` and `save` now support forwarding all `Backend.Screen` options, which enables you to use `record(...; px_per_unit=2.0)` for higher resolution videos with CairoMakie, or e.g. `save(...; backend=GLMakie, ssao=true)`.
* All backend screen types have been renamed to `Backend.Screen`, which was previously not the case. This shouldn't break too much code, since the only backend where one was interacting with `Screen` is GLMakie, which was already named `Screen`. In the future, it will be more common to interact with `Screen` directly for all backends. Use `?Backend.Screen` to see all screen options.

### Speed and allocation improvements for record

We gained some substantial speed improvements for `record`, by reusing more screen state and directly writing out to a file via ffmpeg [#2231](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl/pull/2231).

### Other

* adding more tests for display / record
* CairoMakie now opens a browser/os-image-viewer when plotpane is disabled or `display(fig)` is called explicitely.
* deprecation of `Makie.inline!(false/true)` which was only disabling show, which isn't very helpful (can just be done by `fig;` or `return nothing`) and was instead making trouble accidantely disabling show.
* deprecating `GLMakie.set_window_config!(; screen_config...)` in favor of `GLMakie.activate!(; screen_config...)`.
* deprecating internal function `backend_display` in favor of `display`.
* cleaning up `colorbuffer(figlike)` and `colorbuffer(screen)`, making it faster and more consistent across backends.
* clean up of unused code and making code more consistent between backends
* backend is now registered as module not it's own `GLMakieBackend` struct. Deprecated internal global `current_backend` in favor of `CURRENT_BACKEND` and renaming `register_backend!` to `set_active_backend!`. One can now query the current backend via `Makie.current_backend()::Module`
* `Backend.activate!(; screen_config...)` now always accepts attributes for the backends screen config, and writes it to the theme. Alternatively, one can use `set_theme!(Backend=(screen_config...,))`
* better warnings for wrong ffmpeg flags in `record`/`Record`
